# (Prosper Loan Data)
## by (Naomi Kamweru)


## Dataset

> This dataset consists of information on 113937 prosper loan listings 
with 81 variables including Borrower APR, Credit Grade, Prosper Rating 
and Occupation among many others.


## Summary of Findings

> From the exploration, I found out that the Credit Grade and Prosper 
Rating of a listing, significantly affect the borrower APR. I also 
found out that the borrower's occupation, significantly affect the 
original loan amount and the monthly loan payment where I saw that 
students had the lowest monthly loan payment.
> I also explored on the relation between income range and the original
loan amount where I found out that those earning more have a higher 
original loan amount but those earning less have more outliers than 
those earning more. This was gathered through a box plot.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> I focused on the presentation between all the variables stated.
> The variables in the investigation are Credit Grade, Prosper Rating,
Income Range and Occupation
I started by showing the distributions of the variables in the data set. 
I then went ahead to show the relation between the variables and the 
Borrower APR and the Original Loan Amount.
> Lastly, I showed how the Borrower APR was affected by a combination of 
two variables together.
